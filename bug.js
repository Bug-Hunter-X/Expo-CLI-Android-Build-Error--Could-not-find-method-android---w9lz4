This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with the error message `Could not find method android() for arguments [directory '/path/to/your/project/android'] on object of type org.gradle.api.Project` . This is often related to a mismatch between the Gradle version specified in your project and the version expected by the Expo CLI or the Android build system. Another potential cause could be incorrect configurations in your `android/build.gradle` or `android/app/build.gradle` files.
