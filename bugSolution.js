The solution involves verifying and updating your Gradle configurations. 
1. **Check Gradle Version Compatibility:** Ensure that the Gradle version specified in your project's `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file is compatible with Expo. Check Expo's documentation for the supported Gradle version for your SDK version. Update the distributionUrl if necessary.
2. **Review `android/build.gradle`:**  Examine the `android/build.gradle` file for any potential errors or misconfigurations. Make sure the plugin versions are aligned with your Expo SDK.
3. **Inspect `android/app/build.gradle`:** Check for any discrepancies in this file regarding dependencies or configurations. Make sure all necessary plugins are included correctly and that any dependencies are compatible with each other.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, try cleaning and rebuilding the project using `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android`. This process helps refresh the build environment and resolve potential caching issues.
